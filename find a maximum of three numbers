# Write a program to find a maximum of three numbers.
def maximum(a, b, c):
    if (a >= b) and (a >= c):
        largest = a
    elif (b >= a) and (b >= c):
        largest = b
    else:
        largest = c
    return largest  # Return should be at the same level as the if-else

# Input three numbers
a = int(input("Enter a number: "))
b = int(input("Enter b number: "))
c = int(input("Enter c number: "))

# Call the function and print the result
print("The maximum of the three numbers is:", maximum(a, b, c))


Example Output:
Copy code
Enter a number: 5
Enter b number: 8
Enter c number: 3
The maximum of the three numbers is: 8
